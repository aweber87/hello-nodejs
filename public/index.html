            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Amanda Weber but my friends call me Mandy. I was born in San Jose, California, however, I moved to North Carolina when I was six, so I grew up in the Durham/Raleigh area. My father is originally from Florida and my mother is from the Philippines. I have one sister, named Megan. We grew up in private school, both attending Cresset Christian Academy, in Durham.</p>
            <p>After high school graduation, I attended Winthrop University, in Rock Hill South Carolina. I graduated in 2009 with a Bachelors of Science in Business Administration, with a concentration in Marketing. Upon completion of college I moved back to Durham. Where I searched for a job in my field.
            </p>
            <p>Graduating in 2009 was not the best time to find a job in my field. I ended up working as a server at California Pizza Kitchen until I got a job as a banker working for Wells Fargo. I worked at Wells Fargo for four years and then ended up taking a management position at a resturant in 2013. I stayed as a resturant manager till 2019! At that point I decided that the resturant life was not for me anymore. This is when I decided to go back to school and persue my degree in Data Science and Programming Suppoort.
            </p>

            <p>I have three children, that was the main reason I decided to leave resturant management. I have a two daughters and a son. Tinsley, my oldest, was born in March of 2017. I then had my son, Dash, two years later in August of 2019. And my youngest, Skylar, was born in October of 2021.</p>
            <p>Now I am a full time student. I have 4 classes and an internship left till I can graduate. My goal is to graduate in December 2022. I work nights as a bartender at Ruth's Chris Steakhouse. When I am not working or in school I am spending time with my family.</p>
